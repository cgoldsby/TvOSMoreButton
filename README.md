# TvOSMoreButton
> üì∫ A tvOS button which truncates long text with '... More'.

The TvOSMoreButton is a simple view which aims to mirror the behavior of Apple's "... More" button; as seen in the Movie App.

## Features

If the text is too long to fit with in the button bounds then the text will be truncated and '... More' will be appended.

By default, if the text is truncated the button will be focusable. If the text is not truncated then the button will not be focusable.

However, you can set `focusableMode` to `manual(_ isFocusable: Bool)` to alter the focus behavior. This mode will force the button to be always be focused or never be focused.

When the button is focused, pressing select on the Apple TV remote will trigger a callback.

The majority of the UI properties are configurable; like
- the button text
- ellipse text; defaults to '...'
- trailing text; defaults to "More"
- trailing text color and font
- the button text color and font
- shadows and radius
- and More üòâ

## Requirements

- tvOS 9.0+

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with Homebrew using the following command:

```
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate TvOSMoreButton into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your Cartfile:

```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built TvOSMoreButton.framework into your Xcode project.

## Usage example

Please check out the Example workspace for more details.

```swift
    import TvOSMoreButton

    private func setUpUI() {
        tvOSMoreButton.text = // Super long text
        tvOSMoreButton.buttonWasPressed = {
            [weak self] text in
            self?.moreButtonWasPressed(text: text)
        }
    }

    private func moreButtonWasPressed(text: String?) -> Void {
        // Do something. May I suggest using TvOSTextViewerViewController
        // to display the text in a full screen view!
        let viewController = TvOSTextViewerViewController()
        viewController.text = text
        viewController.textColor = .white
        viewController.textEdgeInsets = UIEdgeInsets(top: 100, left: 250, bottom: 100, right: 250)
        present(viewController, animated: true)
    }

```
