### More control over when button is focused 🔢
This release adds new functionality, `focusableMode` to define when the button should be focus (#29).

By default the focusable mode is set to `auto`. When the text is too long the button will be focusable, else it will not be focusable. This is the current behavior.

In addition, you can set the focusable mode to `manual(_ isFocusable: Bool)`. This mode will force the button to be always be focused or never be focused.

Released on 2017-09-16.
### Swift 4 and Xcode 9

**Xcode 9 and 3.2+ is now required.**

**Changes**

This library has been migrated to Swift 4.

No API changes.

**Swift 3.2 Support**

If your project is using Swift 3.2, you can still use this release by overriding the `SWIFT_VERSION` to be 4.0 in your Podfile.

```ruby
post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
        if target.name == 'TvOSMoreButton'
            target.build_configurations.each do |config|
                config.build_settings['SWIFT_VERSION'] = '4.0'
            end
        end
    end
end
```

 Or, you can use the previous release, [1.0.2](https://github.com/cgoldsby/TvOSMoreButton/releases/tag/1.0.2), which does not require the `post_install` hook and will compile just fine with Xcode 9 and Swift 3.2.
